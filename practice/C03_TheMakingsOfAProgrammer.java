// If I had to guess, the amount of statements a program can contain should be an amount that is below the maximum amount of statements needed to fill the total size of the integer limit. This depends on the program's platform, the system's CPU and internal memory. Because Java's integer limit is 2147483647, it is probably 2147483646 bytes.
// According to ChatGPT, the smallest statement in Java is a semicolon, which contains 8 bits or 1 byte in UTF-8. So... maybe 2147483646 statements?
